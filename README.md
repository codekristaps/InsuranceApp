# InsuranceApp
 
This is a side project that I am building. It's an insurance app where you can buy and sell insurances depending on your user permissions. I will be updating this from time to time.

## Register and login

Registration and login, as well as areas are scaffolded and adjusted per needs. You will need to register your own Google API for signing in, as well as host a local database.
